I created this repository to try to understand how unit test creation works using the Gtest framework.
It really is an extremely simple project, it contains several design errors in the tests and it may not make sense in many parts, but hey, did I already said that I'm learning?

Besides, it's a good time to use the test badges in the README.

*Side notes: I apologize in advance if people's names appear too often in my repositories, I think by now we all know why.
I think your name it's now a constant.*
